        <h1>How to draw a water droplet!</h1>
        <p>First, why do we have to know?</p>
        <p>Drawing water droplet can help you get better drawing skill and you can do it when you are bored.
            It also take only a few minutes to draw it when you get good at it.</p>
        <h3>Materials needed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pencil</li>
            <li>paper</li>
            <li>eraser</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step by Step Instruction:</h3>
        <h3>1. Draw an ellipse</h3>
        <p>This ellipse will be the base of your water droplet. It can be circle or long ellipse...any way you want.</p>
        <h3>2. Add gradient inside the ellipse</h3>
        <p>It is shade of the water droplet. 
            To do it easy, fill the ellipse with pencil, erase in a circle on bottom and rub it with your finger lightly until it looks good.</p>
        <h3>3. Add gradient outside the ellipse</h3>
        <p>It is also shade of the water droplet. You can color it with pencil around the bottom of ellipse and rub it with you finger.</p>
        <h3>4. Add highlight with eraser on top of ellipse.</h3>
        <p>Final part!! Erase 2 or 3 big and small circles on top of ellipse for highlight.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Are you doing it well?</h3>
        <p>This is just my style of drawing water droplet, so there's no right or wrong doing it if it looks like water droplet.</p>
        <p>Just look at your picture and if it looks like a water droplet! If it's not, maybe practice drawing gradients or 
            use better eraser to draw highlight more clearly.</p>
